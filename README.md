# macOS-Catalina-10.15-Legacy-Java-6-Dependencies
Java 6 cannot currently be installed on macOS 10.15 Catalina because there is a newer version of Java installed on the system. Attempts to reinstall legacy Java libraries upon upgrade of the OS may result in errors restricting installation. Some users have also experienced their previously existing legacy Java libraries have been moved or quarantined. This renders ENVI/IDL unusable.
